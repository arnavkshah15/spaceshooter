SpaceShooter is an exhilarating arcade-style game where players navigate a spaceship through a meteor-filled universe. The game features a dynamic health bar to track the spaceship's life and a scoreboard to display the player's progress. Players can collect power-ups like the "Shield," which enhances the ship's durability, and the "Bolt," which boosts its firepower to shoot multiple bullets at once. The game is enriched with custom sounds and sprite animations for events like meteorite explosions, bullet shoots, and player collisions. With three lives per game, SpaceShooter offers a fun and challenging experience that keeps players engaged and entertained.
